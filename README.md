# Day-Planner
#### Description
This application is a Work Day Scheduler. The user can save tasks to do throughout their 9am - 5pm day to better keep track of them. The scheduler will change color based on the time of day to ask as an additional visual guild to items that should have been completed, must be done and to plan for. The current date will be displayed along with the days temperature. 

The focus point of this application is the use of Javascript and Jquery DOM, local browser storage, API and click events methodologies.
Additionally, twitter bootstrap and custom css were used to provide the user interface and responsiveness of the application.

#### Steps to use:
1. Click into a time slot
2. Type a task that you wish to complete in that time e.g. Go to meeting, Lunch with Ben.
3. Save the task by clicking the Save button.
4. If you modify a task remember to save these changes - if not it will not get added to your browser storage.
